add a physical wall (visible line) under the goals so balls cant bounce into a goal
when balls first spawn, avoid spawning them inside the goals
the physical line should disappear when user is dragging a ball and reappear 1 second after the ball is released

3 seconds after the game starts, the letters inside the goals should randomly glitch out of the screen 1 second apart

when game starts choose 3 random words from list
progress bar should increase for each correct letter placed
make letters glitch in at the beginning of the word before glitching out
improve the ui make it more game like
when ball is dropped only give it velocity and direction if it is in the wrong goal
